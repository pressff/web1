  <h2>WEB</h2>
  <p>The World Wide Web, commonly known as the WWW and the Web,
    is an information space where documents and other web resources are identified by
    Uniform Resource Locators which may be interlinked by hypertext,
    and are accessible via the Internet.[1] The resources of the WWW may be accessed by
    users via a software application called a web browser.
    Web resources may be any type of downloadable media,
    but web pages are hypertext media which have been formatted in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).
    Such formatting allows for embedded hyperlinks which contain URLs and permit users
    to easily navigate to other web resources. In addition to text, web pages may contain
    images, video, audio, and software components that are rendered in the user's web browser as
    coherent pages of multimedia content.
